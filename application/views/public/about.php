								<h4>Our Inspiration </h4>
							</div>
							<p>Did you know from our research 90% of childcare institutions in Kenya and across Africa are still using a paper-based system to communicate valuable information about a child’s daily activities and learning progress to their parents? <br>
							During our many interviews with parents and teachers, some of the most reoccurring problems stated, were lack of effective communication between parents and teachers, and not always being able to provide meal plans or daily reports in the children diaries due to time constraints.</p>
